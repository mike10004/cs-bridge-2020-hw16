# Question 1

Implement a symbol balance checker function for the Pascal programming 
language. Pascal allows for the following pairs: {}, (), [], begin end. All 
programs will begin with the word "begin" and end  with the word "end". Your 
function should receive an ifstream object which is already open and will 
return true, all of the symbols match, or false, they do not.  You do not have 
to worry about comments in the program but you do have to avoid other parts of 
the program's code such as assignment statements (x=y) and other expressions.
